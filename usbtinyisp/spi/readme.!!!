TS-Labs (2013)

Patch for USBTinyISP to use PD2 as 12MHz clock out for programming AVR chips with external clock.

Changes to USBTinyISP ATtiny2313 pinout:
	- D- moved to PD1 (was PD3)
	- D+ moved to PD3 (was PD2)
	- PD2 used as CKOUT

Changes to USBTinyISP connector:
	- pin 3 now used as 12MHz out (was NC)

MUST be compiled with Winavr-20060421 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/20060421/).
WinAVR-20100110 produces non-working code!!!

Fuses for ATtiny2313:
CKOUT enabled:	3F DF BF FF
CKOUT disabled:	3F DF FF FF
